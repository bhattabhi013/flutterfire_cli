## Contribution types

### Bug Reports

- If you find a bug, please first report it using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/invertase/flutterfire_cli/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5Bbug%5D%3A++).
  - First check if there is not already an issue for it; duplicated issues will be closed.

### Bug Fix

- If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, please read the [How To](#how-to-contribute) for how to send a pull request.
- Indicate on the open issue that you are working on fixing the bug and the issue will be assigned to you.
- Write `Fixes #xxxx` in your PR text, where xxxx is the issue number (if there is one).
- Include a test that isolates the bug and verifies that it was fixed.

### New Features

- If you'd like to add a feature to the library that doesn't already exist, feel free to describe the feature in a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/invertase/flutterfire_cli/issues/new/choose).
- If you'd like to implement the new feature, please wait for feedback from the project maintainers before spending too much time writing the code. In some cases, enhancements may not align well with the project future development direction.
